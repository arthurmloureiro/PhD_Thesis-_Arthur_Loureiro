I, \thesisName , confirm that the work presented in this thesis is my own.
         Where information has been derived from other sources, I confirm that this has been indicated in the thesis. In particular, I would like to point out the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The photometric systematic maps in Chapter \ref{Chap:BOSS} converted into \healpix maps by my co-author, Bruno Moraes.
    \item The Pseudo-$C_{\ell}$ estimator used in Chapter \ref{Chap:BOSS} has been written by Filipe B. Abdalla and Shaun Thomas, and later adapted for \texttt{python} for other uses by myself.
    \item The \uclcl and \texttt{UCLPI} codes used in Chapters \ref{Chap:BOSS}, \ref{Chap:BOSS-Cosmo} and \ref{Chap:Neutrinos} were written as a collective effort by my co-authors Sreekumar T. Balan, Michael McLeod, Andrei Cuceu, Lorne Whiteway, Filipe B. Abdalla, and myself.
    \item The implementation of external data likelihoods into \texttt{UCLPI} was performed by Andrei Cuceu.
    \item The Bayesian-$C_{\ell}$ estimator and Guided Hamiltonian Sampler used in Chapter \ref{Chap:BPL} were originally presented in \cite{SreeThesis} and later adapted by myself to work with Galaxy Clustering data.
    \item The work presented in Chapters \ref{Chap:BOSS} and \ref{Chap:BOSS-Cosmo} was published in \cite{2018LoureiroBOSS}.
    \item The work presented in Chapter \ref{Chap:Neutrinos} was published in \cite{2018LoureiroNeutrinos}.
\end{itemize}
